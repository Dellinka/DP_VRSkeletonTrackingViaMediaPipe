# Skeleton tracking in VR using MediaPipe
This repository contains the source code for the first proposed, developed and evaluated solution for my masters thesis, which explores the potential use of virtual reality technology in enhancing the sensorimotor walkway exercise for elderly individuals. The goal was to develop a person body tracking solution in virtual reality using MediaPipe. 

The repository is divided into Android and Oculus applications. The Android application utilizes MediaPipes body landmarks tracking solution, which was customized in order to communicate with Oculus headset through UDP communication. The Oculus application presents a basic sample scene and display received data from the android application as a mirrored skeleton.
